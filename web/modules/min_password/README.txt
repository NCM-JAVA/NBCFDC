Min password

This small module allows you to configure the minimum password
length for all users on the site. Passwords are not affected,
simple verification has been added. You can configure minimum
password length on the /admin/config/people/accounts page.

The password length checked on user registration and user edit pages.
This module also corrects the password edit form in password reset
process - for this case the user can click Save and gets a zero-length
password as a result.
